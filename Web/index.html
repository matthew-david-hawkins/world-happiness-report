            <p>In 2012 the United Nations published their first <a href="https://worldhappiness.report/">World Happiness Report</a>. Since then, updates to this report have analyzed data collected from 2005 to 2019 on happiness around the world.
              This report highlights a continuing problem -- some of the world's economic powerhouses, while greatly increasing their Gross National Product (a measure of the dollar value of all the goods and services produced in a nation) show no significant increase in happiness on average.
              For example, while the per-person Gross National Product of the U.S. increased three-fold between 1960 and 2010, its inhabitants reported no significant change in happiness over that period.<br><br>Whatever benefits this massive increase in productivity may have brought, happier people has not been one of them. 
              Meanwhile, the costs of running these economic engines pile up in the form of climate change, pollution, dwindling natural resources, and economic inequality.
              <br><br>The writers of the World Happiness Report point out a possible way out of this destructive trend. It's an idea that comes from the small nation of Bhutan, where, in 1972, the nation's king committed his government to increasing what he termed 
              "Gross National Happiness." The World Happiness Report aims to make it possible for governments as well as individuals to make informed decisions about how to create happy societies.<br><br>But, to achieve that goal, we have to use this data.
